# bracket

Single elimination tournaments are often conceptualized as a tree structure called a "bracket".
This package provides R tools to set up a single elimination tournament given a list of participants,
update the state of the tournament given the winners of previous matches,
and depict the current state of the tournament in a plot of the corresponding tournament bracket.

## Installation

You can install this package via the R command

```r
devtools::install_github("SentientPotato/bracket")
