Description: Single elimination tournaments are often conceptualized as a tree
    structure called a "bracket". This package provides tools to set up a
    single elimination tournament given a list of participants, update the
    state of the tournament given the winners of previous matches, and depict
    the current state of the tournament in a plot of the corresponding
    tournament bracket.
